§4§lVersion 1.2.0§r

This update features the first full release of Crafting Dead Immerse. Immerse adds a fancy new menu which you're looking at right now, but most excitingly it brings the much anticipated game mode system. We are currently hosting a single Team Deathmatch server which you can check out by pressing the play button to your left but there's more on its way in future updates.

Also, at the time of writing this, new gun models are in development which will replace all existing models in the game. This will bring a much needed refresh to the original 1.6.4 models (which you may notice are a bit glitchy in 1.16 due to the conversion to the new model format).

Our builders are still hard at work finishing off the maps for the official (survival) servers. In the mean time hop on to our alpha server, play some TDM, perhaps start a server of your own or play solo in a singleplayer world.
